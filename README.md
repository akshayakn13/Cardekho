# Introduction
Hello everyone! In this we will be working on Vehicle dataset from cardekho Dataset . This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com. We are going to use for finding predictions of price with the use of regression models.

The datasets consist of several independent variables include:

    Car_Name
    Year
    Selling_Price
    Present_Price
    Kms_Driven
    Fuel_Type
    Seller_Type
    Transmission
    Owner

We are going to use some of the variables which we need for regression models.

# Problem Statement

Required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
